# qyubey-production-experiences
A repo to lead aspiring DTM producers astray,

## Who is Qyubey, anyways?
If you have to ask this question, and you mean it, you have come to the wrong repository. Go away


## What is this repo?
This repository summarizes my experiences as a music producer.

In short, I have been led astray by nu-merous youtube tutorials, tips, sample packs, and horrible monitors. This repo exists so that you will not make the same mistakes I have made in the past.

However, you will be led astray anyways, so I guess there is no point.
No tip is universally useful.
Take these tips with a grain of salt. Actually, many grains of salt.

## How should I read this?
The .md files will be put in this repo. They will have a numbering on them on the front.
The smaller this number is, the more important the tip contained within is.

Once again, take everything with a grain of salt.

# TODO
* Actually write stuff
* Make a script, to mail me this repo 12 yrs later
